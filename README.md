# Guitar-Hero-II-Deluxe-360

![Header Image](dependencies/header.png)

## Introduction

This Repo contains everything you need to build an ark for gh2dx 360, and also runs the included xex on a PC with an included build of Xenia.
Xenia is pre setup for portable installation with its own config file that disables vsync, and sets an option in this specific build (max_queued_frames = 3)

Unlock all is enabled by default, and the goal of this specific version of gh2 is to strip out as much fluff as possible. The ui philosophy is deliberately taking cues from [Clone Hero](https://clonehero.net/)  
Pad play is not currently available in this build.
Instead, we have opted to treat all connected controllers as a guitar.
This can allow more controller compatibility, but also allow online coop via parsec. We tried it, it's really fun.

A specific build of [x360ce 3.2](https://www.x360ce.com/) that supports guitar mappings is also included if you need it.

## Install

Setting up GHIIDX 360 for the first time is meant to be as easy as possible.
As well, it is designed to allow you to automatically receive updates as the repo is updated.

Simply run "_init_repo.bat".

This will walk you through installing a couple dependencies, [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), and [Dot Net 6.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime).
Git is required for you to take advantage of auto updating via github pulls. Dot Net is required to build an ARK file, the archive format the game needs to run.
You can setup git with all default options, same with dot net.

Once the dependencies are installed, git will pull the repo and make sure you are completely up to date.

From then on simply run "_gh2.bat". This script will pull the repo again for updates, build the ARK for you, and finally, launch the game in Xenia.
All in one script. It is recommended to always run the game with gh2.bat to ensure everything is up to date, as currently this project is highly WIP

## Songs + DLC

Guitar Hero II Deluxe 360 by default only comes with one song. [Exilelord's Speed Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoHeIiDHbdk).

You can install song packs directly in your local copy of this repo in

>\content\415607E7\00000002\XXXXXX

Where XXXXXX is the name of your song pack, containing both a "songs" and a "config" folder.
con/live files are not supported.

There is a max package limit of 16 song packs. Currently there is a max song limit of around 200 songs due to setlist issues.

You can find Vanilla song packs for [GHIIDX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xwX_Dv17WDFldZ0mDWZu71FLUI-CTywx/view?usp=sharing) and [GH80SDX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KJxH51N2yQdQXlNA9MmyrI1bGfdB6Hxz/view?usp=sharing) here.


You can also use [Onyx Music Game Toolkit](https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs) to generate your own custom song packs for GH2 360.

## Custom Highways
This repo also supports the usage of custom highways via the use of an all in one bat and a couple external dependencies also included.

Simply drag in a .jpg/.png/.bmp into the "highways" folder at the root of the repo, then run "_highways.bat"
This will size your images accordingly (supports arbitrary resolutions), and convert them to the proper format for gh2 to read.
ARK files will be generated for a list of your custom highways in game to choose from at will using the overshell (select select on most all menues)

After running "_highways.bat" you will need to run "_gh2.bat" again to build your new ARK.
